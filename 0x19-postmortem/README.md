### Postmortem Report: User Authentication Service Outage

**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration of the outage:** April 28, 2024, from 10:15 AM to 11:45 AM (EST)
- **Impact:** The user authentication service was down, preventing 75% of users from logging into the application. Users experienced login failures and were unable to access their accounts.
- **Root Cause:** The root cause was a misconfigured database connection string following a scheduled database migration.

**Timeline:**

- **10:15 AM:** Issue detected by an automated monitoring alert indicating a spike in failed login attempts.
- **10:17 AM:** Incident response team notified via Slack.
- **10:20 AM:** Initial investigation began focusing on the authentication microservice.
- **10:25 AM:** Assumption made that the issue was related to recent code deployments; rolled back latest deployment.
- **10:40 AM:** Rollback unsuccessful in resolving the issue; escalated to the database team.
- **10:45 AM:** Database team joined the investigation; checked database health and recent changes.
- **11:00 AM:** Discovered misconfiguration in the database connection string caused by a recent migration.
- **11:05 AM:** Corrected the database connection string in the configuration file.
- **11:15 AM:** Restarted the authentication service; monitored system recovery.
- **11:45 AM:** Confirmed that the issue was resolved and the authentication service was fully operational.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

**Root Cause:**
The issue was traced back to a misconfigured database connection string following a scheduled migration. During the migration process, the database endpoint was updated, but the new connection string was not properly propagated to the configuration of the authentication microservice. This misconfiguration caused the microservice to fail when attempting to connect to the database, leading to the login failures experienced by users.

**Resolution:**
The resolution involved identifying and correcting the misconfigured database connection string. Once the correct connection string was applied, the authentication microservice was restarted, restoring normal functionality. The specific steps included:
1. Identifying the incorrect database connection string.
2. Updating the configuration file with the correct connection string.
3. Restarting the authentication service to apply the changes.
4. Monitoring the service to ensure it was functioning as expected.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

**Improvements and Fixes:**
- **Configuration Management:** Implement stricter controls and validation for configuration changes, especially following migrations.
- **Automated Testing:** Enhance automated tests to include checks for configuration integrity and connectivity post-deployment.
- **Monitoring Enhancements:** Improve monitoring to detect configuration-related issues more swiftly.

**Tasks:**
1. **Patch Database Migration Script:** Update the script to automatically verify and propagate new connection strings.
2. **Add Monitoring:** Implement monitoring for database connectivity specifically for the authentication service.
3. **Enhance Logging:** Improve logging around configuration loading and database connection attempts for easier debugging.
4. **Configuration Review:** Conduct a thorough review of configuration management practices and implement a peer-review process for changes.
5. **Automated Deployment Checks:** Integrate automated checks that validate connection strings and other critical configurations post-deployment.

By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to minimize the risk of similar issues occurring in the future, ensuring more robust and reliable service for our users.
