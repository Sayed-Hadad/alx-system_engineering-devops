## Title Explanation:

- **What is a server?**
  A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

- **What is the role of the domain name?**
  The domain name serves as the address for a website on the internet, allowing users to easily access and identify a specific web location. It's like the digital equivalent of a street address, directing traffic to the correct destination.

- **What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com?**
  DNS record called a CNAME

- **What is the role of the web server?**
  The web server serves web content to users' browsers upon request.

- **What is the role of the application server?**
  The application server handles the dynamic processing of requests made by users, typically for web applications. It manages tasks such as executing server-side code, interacting with databases, and generating dynamic content in response to user input.

- **What is the role of the database?**
  The database stores and manages structured data used by applications. It provides a structured way to organize, manage, and retrieve data efficiently. This data could include user information, product details, transaction records, and more. The database ensures data integrity, security, and scalability, allowing applications to access and manipulate data as needed.

- **What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website?**
  Linux Server

## Title: Issues with LAMP Infrastructure:

1. **SPOF (Single Point of Failure):** If any component (like the web server) fails, the entire system can go down.

2. **Downtime during Maintenance:** Deploying new code often requires restarting the web server, causing downtime.

3. **Scaling Limitations:** Difficulty scaling to handle high traffic due to constraints of server resources and architecture.
