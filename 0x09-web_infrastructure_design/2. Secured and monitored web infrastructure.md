## Title Explanation:

- **For every additional element, why are you adding it?**
  Additional elements like firewalls, HTTPS, and monitoring tools are added to enhance security and performance. Firewalls protect against unauthorized access and malicious attacks. HTTPS encrypts traffic to ensure data confidentiality and integrity. Monitoring tools track system performance, detect anomalies, and facilitate proactive management.

- **What are firewalls for?**
  Firewalls act as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules. They help prevent unauthorized access, malware, and other cyber threats.

- **Why is the traffic served over HTTPS?**
  Traffic is served over HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the server and the client, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. HTTPS protects against eavesdropping, data tampering, and other security risks associated with transmitting data over unsecured HTTP.

- **What monitoring is used for?**
  Monitoring is used to track the performance, availability, and health of IT infrastructure components and applications in real-time. It helps identify issues, optimize resource usage, and ensure optimal performance and reliability.

- **How is the monitoring tool collecting data?**
  The monitoring tool collects data by periodically querying system metrics, logs, and other relevant sources from the monitored components. It may use agents installed on servers, SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), API calls, or other methods to gather data.

- **Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS (Queries Per Second)?**
  To monitor web server QPS, you can use monitoring tools that provide metrics related to server performance, such as CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic, and request rate. You can set up alerts to notify you if QPS exceeds predefined thresholds, allowing you to take proactive actions to optimize server performance and prevent overload.

## Title: Issues with Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure:

- **Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue?**
  Terminating SSL at the load balancer level decrypts HTTPS traffic, exposing sensitive data within the internal network. This increases the risk of data interception and compromises security.

- **Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue?**
  Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes creates a single point of failure. If this server fails, it can lead to data loss and service downtime, impacting the availability and reliability of the application.

- **Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server, and application server) might be a problem?**
  Having servers with identical components increases the risk of systemic failures due to common vulnerabilities or software bugs. It also limits flexibility and scalability, as different components may have different resource requirements or performance characteristics.
